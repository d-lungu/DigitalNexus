        In April 2006 our company registered on the Ebay platform, with the
        username (account still active and owned by us): <span class="font-bold"
            >Digi.Nexus01</span
        >, quickly becoming a Platinum level PowerSeller with 2029 positive
        feedbacks. Due to high commissions we have stopped publishing the
        products on Ebay.
