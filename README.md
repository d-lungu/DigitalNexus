## About the project
We were tasked by our teacher with creating a web application using a JavaScript framework. The application was to utilize one or more datasets and process them, transforming raw data into meaningful information.

We chose to make an app which mimicked [PcPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/): a website that can help you make your own PC.

The project was a group effort, and we had to manage everything from scratch. We started with a Trello board, outlining our user stories and defining the scope of our project. This helped us to visualize our goals and track our progress. We then moved on to designing a mockup of our application using Figma. This allowed us to get a feel for the user interface and experience before we even wrote a single line of code.

To keep our project on track, we created a Gantt diagram and a WBS chart. These tools helped us to allocate tasks, manage our time effectively, and ensure that every member of our team knew what they were responsible for.

When it came to choosing a JavaScript framework for our application, I decided on Svelte. This was my first experience with Svelte (and with component-based frameworks), and I was eager to learn and explore its capabilities. The process was challenging at times, but it was also incredibly rewarding. I learned a lot about Svelte and web development in general, and I feel that I have grown as a developer because of this project, although this caused the codebase to be rather messy and a lot of hacky solutions were used as we had not a lot of time developing it.

We are proud of what we have accomplished and look forward to applying what we have learned in our future projects.
